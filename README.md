This is my sandbox for learning Java, not a specific project.

Some projects I already made in jGRASP and since they are pretty basic I will not probably import them here.

Now I am stariting to work on IntelliJ and I intenting to import all or at least some more interesting code here, enjoy!

This could also work as my portfolio, we'll see :)
